Project
Create a project to scan the files in the downloads folder 
and categorize them as compressed (for rar, zip, 7zip files), 
documents (txt, xlsx, pdf, etc.), audio and 
video files.

Steps:

Read the Downloads Directory: Use fs.readdir or fs.readdirSync 
to list all files in the downloads directory.

Categorize Files: Loop through the files, 
use the path module to extract file extensions, and 
categorize files based on their extension (path.extname() method).
Move Files: Create separate folders for each category 
and move files into the appropriate folder
using fs.rename or fs.copyFile.
