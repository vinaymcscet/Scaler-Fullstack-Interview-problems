Ques-1 -> (Machine Coding: Q1 Counter)

    Raw Problem
    Problem Description:
    Write a JS program to successfully make the given Counter function.


    counter-gif


    The counter has several components with dedicated functions, here is the list for the same:
    1. span#number => contains the current number value.
    2. input#increment => field that takes the input for the increment number/factor. (default is 1)
    3. button#add => when clicked updates the span#number by adding increment number to it.
    4. button#subtract => when clicked updates the span#number by subtracting increment number from it.
    5. button#reset => changes the span#number to 0 again.

    Make sure the input for increment number is always parsed to Integer using parseInt(input).

    Use the above information to write the entire JS program in the script.js file or script tag.
    Refer to the test cases to further understand the criteria to submit the problem successfully.

Ques-2 -> (Machine Coding: Q2 OTP Input)

    Raw Problem
    Problem Description:

    Write a JS program to make the given OTP input work properly.


    OTP-gif


    In the Document, you have div#inputs that contain 4 input fields with 'input' class.
    Here is how these inputs should work:
    1. Each of the fields only takes a single-digit number as input.
    2. When a number is entered, the focus moves to the next input field.
    3. Pressing Backspace or Delete key removes the input of the current field, and the focus moves to the previous field.

    You can utilise methods like isNan(value), Element.focus(), Element.nextElementSibling and Element.previousElementSibling to make the above-mentioned features work.

    Use the above information to write the entire JS program in the script.js file or script tag.
    Refer to the test cases to further understand the criteria to submit the problem successfully.

Ques-3 -> (Machine Coding: Q3 Product Cards)

    Raw Problem
    Write a JS program to display information of various products from a list.
    Read the entire problem description carefully to understand the necessary details.

    Product-cards-image

    You are provided with: (Don't make any changes to the below-mentioned files)
    1. index.html => containing basic document structure
    2. styles.css => contains styling
    3. and data.js => has a data variable that contains an Array of Objects with details of several products.

    As you can access the data array, your task is to
    write a program to make a product card for each of the product's objects inside this array.

    Algorithm:
    1. Traverse through the data Array.
    2. Individually accessing each product's Object.
    3. Inject relevant details like title, category, and rating count in the below-mentioned HTML template to make a div.card.
    4. To make the rating stars:

    4.1. Round off the rating.rate value of an object to the nearest Integer
    4.2. Use this value to determine the number of empty and filled stars out of 5. (Ex: For a rating of 3/5 => 3 filled stars and 2 empty stars)
    4.3. Utilise these values in a loop to make filled and empty stars
    4.4. To make filled star symbol use a span tag with text as '&#9733;' and for empty star use '&#9734;'
    4.5. Note that it is important to add class of 'star__filled' and 'star__notfilled' for respective cases. (To pass final test case)
    4.5. Wrap these stars (span tags) inside a div with class 'all__star'. The final result should be as shown below.
    <div class="all__star">
    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
    <span class="star__notfilled">&#9734;</span>
    </div>
    5. Finally, after the div.card is ready with all the details injected, add it to div#container

    The HTML structure of a card is as follows: (Use this directly as card's HTML template)

    <div class="card">
    <div class="details">
    <span class="product__name">${product.title}</span>
    <br>
    <span class="product__category">${product.category}</span>
    <div class="all__star">
    ${HTML FOR SPANS OF STARS (as discussed in step 4 of Algorithm)}
    </div>
    <div class="rating__count">Rating Count : <span>${product.rating.count}</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="btn">
    <button class="btn__buy">Buy Now</button>
    </div>
    </div>

    and object inside the data array has the following structure: (Note that only a few of these values are required to be injected)
    {
    id: 1,
    title: "Sample Product 1",
    price: 109.95,
    description:
    "Your perfect pack for everyday use and walks in the forest. Stash your laptop (up to 15 inches) in the padded sleeve, your every day",
    category: "men's clothing",
    image: "https://fakestoreapi.com/img/81fPKd-2AYL._AC_SL1500_.jpg",
    rating: {
    rate: 3.9,
    count: 120,
    },
    }

    Use the above information to write the entire JS program in the script.js file or script tag. (below the script tag loading data.js file)
    Refer to the test cases to further understand the criteria to submit the problem successfully.
