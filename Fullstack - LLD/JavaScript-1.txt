Ques-1 -> (JS Core - String Manipulation: Reverse a string)

Create a function called reverseString that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version.

The function is called with the argument of a string that needs to be reversed.
Use array methods to reverse the string.

Input Format
String

Sample Input 0
hello

Sample Output 0
olleh

# Solution -

function reverseString(inputString) {
  // Write your code here
  // return the result
  // Approach - 1
    return inputString.split("").reverse().join("")

    // Approach - 2
    let reversed = "";
    for (let i = inputString.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        reversed += inputString[i];
    }
    return reversed;
}

Ques-2 -> (JS Core - Area of Circle)

Write a function named calculateArea that takes the radius of a circle as a parameter and returns the area.
The calculateArea function is called with the argument and the result is stored in a variable called circleArea.


Input Format
Number


Constraints
n <= 10 ^ 9


Output Format
Number


Sample Input 0
5

Sample Output 0
78.5

# Solution -

    function calculateArea(radius){
        // Write your code here
        // return the result
            let circleArea = (3.14) * radius * radius;
            return circleArea;
    }

Ques-3 -> (JS Core - Conditional Statements)

Write an if-else statement to check if a user is older than 18.
If true, log "You are an adult." otherwise log "You are a minor."

main function will be called with an argument with the value of age.


Input Format
Integer


Constraints
n <= 10 ^ 9


Output Format
String

Sample Input 0
12

Sample Output 0
You are a minor.

# Solution -

    function main(userAge) {
    // Write your code here
    // Use console.log to output the result
        if(userAge > 18) console.log("You are an adult.");
        else console.log("You are a minor.")
    }

Ques-4 -> (JS Core - Loops in Action)

Use a for loop to iterate through an array of numbers and log each element multiplied by 2.

main function will be called with an array of integers as argument.


Input Format
Values of an array

Constraints
n <= 10 ^ 9

Output Format
Logged Integers

[1, 2, 3]

Sample Output 0
2
4
6

# Solution -

    function main(arr) {
    // Write your code here
    // Use console.log to output the result
        for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++) {
            console.log(arr[i] * 2);
        }
    }
