Ques-1 -> (Closures - 3)

    What is a closure in JavaScript?

# Solution - A function that has access to its parent scope and can use its variables after the enclosing function is terminated

Ques-2 -> (Caching Closure)

    Create a JavaScript function that uses closures to implement caching (memoization). The function should cache the results of complex calculations and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
