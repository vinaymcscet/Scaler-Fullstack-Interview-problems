Ques-1 -> (Ref vs Instance 1 (OOPs Basics))

Consider the following class Student
    public class Student {
        int age;
        String name;

        void display(){
            System.out.println("My name is " + this.name + ". I am "  + this.age + " years old");
        }

        void sayHello(String name){
            System.out.println(this.name + " says hello to " + name);
        }
    }
And the following code in Client class

    public class Client {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Student s1 = new Student();
            s1.age = 10;
            s1.name = "A";
            s1.display();

            Student s2 = s1;
            s2.age = 20;
            s2.name = "B";

            s2.display();

            s1.display();
        }
    }
What is the output of the final call to display function i.e. s1.display()?

# Solution - My name is B. I am 20 years old.
