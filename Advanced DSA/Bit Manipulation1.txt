Problem Description - 
    You are given two integers A and B.
    Set the A-th bit and B-th bit in 0, and return output in decimal Number System.

Note: The bit positions are 0-indexed, which means that the least significant bit (LSB) has index 0.

Problem Constraints - 
    0 <= A <= 30
    0 <= B <= 30

Solution - 
    module.exports = { 
    //param A : integer
    //param B : integer
    //return an integer
        solve : function(A, B){
            let C = 0 | (1 << A);
            return C | (1 << B);
        }
    };
