        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => {
            console.log(data);
        });

Ques-3 -> (React: Class 2 - MCQ 11)

    Consider a React component that displays a count and has an “Increment” button. You observe that clicking the “Increment” button rapidly multiple times sometimes results in a lower-than-expected count. What could be causing this issue?
    import React, { useState } from 'react';

    function QuickUpdateIssue() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const incrementCount = () => {
        // Simple useState call
        setCount(count + 1);
    };

    return (
        <div>
        <h1>Quick Update Issue</h1>
        <p>Count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
    }

    export default QuickUpdateIssue;

# Solution - 
    The setCount function is being called directly with the current count.
