Ques-1 -> (Basic Counter with Hooks)

    You are tasked with implementing a basic counter application using React. Your application should allow users to increment and decrement a count value displayed on the screen. The initial value of the count should be 0.
    Instructions
    Create a React component named Counter.
    Use the useState hook to manage the count state within the Counter component. The initial count should be set to 0.
    Implement two functions within the Counter component:
    increment: When called, this function should increase the count by 1.
    decrement: When called, this function should decrease the count by 1.
    Render two buttons within the Counter component:
    One button for incrementing the count. This button should have the text +.
    One button for decrementing the count. This button should have the text -.
    Display the current count value between these two buttons.

# Solution - 
    App.js - 
        import "./App.css";
        import Counter from "./Counter";

        function App() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
            <Counter />
            </div>
        );
        }

        export default App;

    =================
    Counter.js - 
        import React, { useState } from "react";

        // Complete the code
        function Counter() {
        const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
        const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        return (
            <div>
            <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
            <span>{count}</span>
            <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
            </div>
        );
        }

        export default Counter;


Ques-2 -> (Multiple Counters with Hooks)

    In this exercise, you are tasked with creating a React application that displays multiple counter components. Each counter should maintain its own state and have the ability to increment and decrement its value independently of the others.
    Instructions
    Counter Component:
    Create a functional React component named Counter. The component should accept two props: index and value. index: A unique identifier for each counter. value: The initial count value for the counter. Utilize the useState hook to manage the counter's current value, initializing it with the value prop. Implement two functions within the component: increment: Increases the counter's value by 1. decrement: Decreases the counter's value by 1. (Note: There is a bug in the provided code where both increment and decrement functions increase the value. The decrement function should decrease the value.) Render the counter's index, current value, and two buttons to control the counter (increment and decrement).
    ParentCounter Component:
    Create another functional React component named ParentCounter. Inside this component, render multiple Counter components with different initial values and indexes. Example: Render three Counter components with indexes 1, 2, 3, and initial values 2, 3, 4, respectively

# Solution - 
    App.js - 
        import "./App.css";
        import ParentCounter from "./Counter";

        function App() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
            <ParentCounter />
            </div>
        );
        }

        export default App;

    ==================================
    Parent.jsx - 
        import React from "react";
        import Counter from "./Counter";

        function ParentCounter() {
        return <div>
            <Counter index={1} value={2} />
            <Counter index={2} value={3} />
            <Counter index={3} value={4} />
        </div>;
        }

        export default ParentCounter;

    =====================================
    Counter.js - 
        import React, { useState } from "react";

        function Counter({ index, value }) {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(value)
        const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
        const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);

        return (
            <div>
            <h2>Counter Number: {index}</h2>
            <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
            <p>{count}</p>
            <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
            </div>
        );
        }

        export default Counter;


Ques-3 -> (Complete The Gallery)

    When you press “Next” on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible.

    After fixing the crash, add a “Previous” button that shows the previous sculpture. It shouldn’t crash on the first sculpture. app.js

    import { useState } from 'react';
    import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

    export default function Gallery() {
    const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
    const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

    function handleNextClick() {

        setIndex(index + 1);
    }

    function handleMoreClick() {
        setShowMore(!showMore);
    }

    let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
    return (
        <>
        <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
            Next
        </button>
        <h2>
